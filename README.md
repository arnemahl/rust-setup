# Rust setup test

Just playing around so far, trying to get a good setup that shows errors and codestyle warnings in console.

## Packages

Packages I use to make it easier to work with Rust.

#### [cargo watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch)

Use [cargo watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch) to watch for changes.

#### WIP

I want to specify dependencies and scripts to be used for the project, similar to a `package.json` + npm (npm install, npm run &lt;script>, etc.)for JavaScript projects. Not yet sure how this should be done for Rust projects.
